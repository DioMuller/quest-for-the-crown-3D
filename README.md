# Quest for the Crown 3D

This is the repository for Quest for the Crown 3D, our final project game made for PUCPR's Game Development Postgrad.

## Description
This is a top-down exploration game, made using Unity. The assets were included when possible, noted otherwise. The game art assets was made by our development team.

## Environment
Since technology is ever evolving, I cannot guarantee this game will work indefinitely. It was made using those tools:

* Visual Studio 2012
* Unity 5.0

While backwards compatibility and automatic conversion may work for future versions, there may be errors and inconsistencies.

## Contributing
Since this project is a personal project created for education pruposes, no external contributions will be accepted. However, you are free to fork and study the code!
